In May 2024, I graduated with a PhD in Applied Physics from Rice University in Houston, Texas. Under the supervision of Professor Peter G. Wolynes, I used computational methods to explore mechanisms of protein evolution by studying the physical stability and biological function of putative protein elements encoded by pseudogenes and exons.

In May 2017, I graduated with a B.S. in Physics, with minors in Mathematics and Biology, from Texas Christian University (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas. During my time at TCU, I worked with Professor Hana Dobrovolny and helped develop analytical models to predict tumor growth over time. I also worked with Professor Zygmunt Gryczynski, helping characterize the fluorescent properties of synthesized Bodipy dyes.
